#  Big Data Dashboard

The goal was to create a Global COVID-19 Tracker dashboard, visualizing the pandemic's impact globally, and on a per-country selection.

The implementation had to be in the scripting language R, which is oftenly used for creating data visualizations. The map component is based on the Leaflet library.

In the end, the functioning dashboard application was to be hosted on the ShinyApps platform.
